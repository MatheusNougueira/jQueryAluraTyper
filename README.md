<p>
JQuery is a JavaScript library designed to make life easier for a web developer. Its main purpose is to make it easier to use JavaScript on websites, abstracting browser compatibility issues from the developer's head. It also has lean functions, which drastically reduce the amount of code a developer has to write, having modules that make things like AJAX, which is natively complex to do with pure JavaScript, easier.</p>

<h2>Some functions</h2>
<p>JQuery's .text () function is for modifying the text content of tags, so if we want to change the text of a <h1>, we must use it.

The .val () function is to change the values ​​of the input fields, so if we want to populate an <input type = "text"> with a specific value, we will use it.

The .attr () function, as its name suggests, is for changing element attributes, such as the rows and col attributes of a textarea.</p>
