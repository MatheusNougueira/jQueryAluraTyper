JQuery is a JavaScript library designed to make life easier for a web developer. Its main purpose is to make it easier to use JavaScript on websites, abstracting browser compatibility issues from the developer's head. It also has lean functions, which drastically reduce the amount of code a developer has to write, having modules that make things like AJAX, which is natively complex to do with pure JavaScript, easier.</p>
